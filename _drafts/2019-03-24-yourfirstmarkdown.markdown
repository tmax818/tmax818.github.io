I am making a few major assumptions:

1. you have a text editor.
2. you are using a Unix based computer(i.e. Linux or Mac)

If you want to be a good (fill in goal here) you have to practice. No shit, right? The beautiful thing about code is its ephemerality. A restatement of my first sentence could be if you want to be a good (insert here), you have to give yourself permission to be a bad (insert here) for as long as it takes to become a good (insert here). Perhaps it's better and more accurate to say you must embrace being a bad (insert here).

Steven King said it succinctly in his book ON WRITING??? "if you want to be a writer you have to read a lot and you have to write a lot. There is no way around it." The same applies to you, future coding ninja! You got to read a lot and especially write a lot of code! So lets start! Open a terminal and write:

```Bash
$ mkdir example
```

I guess I am assuming you know what a terminal is too. Damn it! Okay, a terminal is "a program that takes commands from the keyboard and gives them to the operating system to perform." This line was stolen from the best book on the command line ever written. Like all good things in life, it's free. Please read as soon as possible, [The Linux Command Line](http://linuxcommand.org/) by William Shotts.

```Bash
$ cd example
```

"Use the Force, Luke." Trust me grasshopper, to a coder, the command line is the fucking Force! Now you're in the example directory. Do you feel any different?

```Bash
$ touch hello_world.rb
```

I don't know why `touch` means make a file! Just. Just... stop asking fucking questions and learn it! Now we're going to make the file for the JavaScript code that does the same fucking thing:

```Bash
$ touch helloWorld.js
```

If you're thinking that .rb stands for Ruby and .js stands for JavaScript, give yourself a cookie! Now comes the hard part. I think you're ready. You need to open this folder(i.e. example), in a text editor. If you are going to use Atom type:

```Bash
$ atom .
```

If you are going to use Code type:

```Bash
$ code .
```

If nothing happens, meaning you don't see a page like this;

You, my friend, are in a world of shit! Just kidding. Seconds ago I couldn't remember the syntax for inserting images in Markdown(the tool I am using to write this blog which you need to learn as soon as possible, but I digress). I typed this `image in md` into none other than Google and I had the answer in seconds. Writing code is 10 percent knowing the code to write and 90 percent knowing how to figure out why the code you wrote isn't working.
