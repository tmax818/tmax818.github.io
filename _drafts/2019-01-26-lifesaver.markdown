[Brad Traversey](https://www.traversymedia.com/) is one of the many mentors I have had that I have never met and who doesn't know that I exist.<!--more--> He did an [autobiographical video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA9krklwADI) on his YouTube channel that is the main inspiration for this post. I don't know if you will ever see this, but I have to say from the bottom of my heart, thank you Brad!

I am the quintessential introvert. Writing this post is profoundly difficult. If you have viewed Brad's video linked above, which I strongly encourage you to do, you will understand my purpose. My life, to this point has been a series of bouts with severe crippling depression. My hope is that this post will find those kindred spirits who will have a visceral response to my last sentence. This terrible disease has been a tremendously destructive force in my life. I have to write this because, I don't think it has to be.
