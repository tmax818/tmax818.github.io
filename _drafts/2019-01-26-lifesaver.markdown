[Brad Traversey](https://www.traversymedia.com/) is one of the many mentors I have had that I have never met and who doesn't know that I exist.<!--more--> He did an [autobiographical video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA9krklwADI) on his YouTube channel that is the main inspiration for this post. I don't know if you will ever see this, but I have to say from the bottom of my heart, thank you Brad!

I am the quintessential introvert. Writing this post is profoundly difficult. If you have viewed Brad's video linked above, which I strongly encourage you to do, you will understand my purpose.

My life, to this point has been a series of bouts with severe and crippling depression. My hope is that this post will find those kindred spirits who will have a visceral response to my last sentence. This terrible disease has been a tremendously destructive force in my life and the lives of millions of my fellow travelers. I have to write this because, I don't think it has to be.

I could go on and on about my childhood and the unfair hand that I have been dealt. Everyone has a sob story. I don't think that is the point. I don't want this to turn into a pep-talk or a motivational seminar. I have found something that I am passionate about. It took me forty years to find it, but it has changed my life for the better. Programming has become my passion. I don't have a job as a programmer as of this writing, but I am confident that I will. Even if I never find a job as a programmer, I will never stop writing code. I love it so much I would do it for free. In fact, I am a volunteer for Code For America, so I am doing it for free now!

I don't think you would be reading this if you didn't already believe in the tremendous power of the Internet to transform lives.
