I share David Heinemeier Hansson's feelings about discovering Ruby that he expressed so eloquently in [The Rails Doctrine](https://rubyonrails.org/doctrine/):

> It was the event that marked my own personal transition from ‘doing programming because I needed programs’ to ‘doing programming because I fell in love with it as a mode of intellectual exercise and expression’.

Programming in general and Ruby in particular have changed my life and have become for me a favored and indispensable mode of intellectual exercise and expression.

If you want to be a web developer, you must learn [HTML, CSS, and JavaScript](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/web-design-html-css-javascript). I don't think I am alone in feeling that the last item on that list is the most arduous of the three. HTML and CSS are not "programming languages" in the strict sense.

HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and CSS is a [style sheet language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_sheet_language). These languages are all about text and how it appears on a web page.

JavaScript, on the other hand, is a full fledged programming language. The boot camp I attended taught Ruby first and then JavaScript. I think learning JavaScript would have been much harder without the background understanding of Ruby.

As much as I love everything about Ruby, at the end of the day it is, like JavaScript, a tool. Ruby, Python, JavaSript etc. are all a means to an end.

My approach, will be to explain JavaScript in terms of Ruby. In other words, use Ruby as a heuristic of sorts. I think learning a programming language can be likened to learning a natural language(i.e. French, German). Someone majoring in a language at university will be required to learn, if not become fluent, in a second language. Wait, why not teach both? Why not use Ruby to understand JavaScript? If you want to join me on this crazy experiment, please read on!
