<h3>About this site</h3>
<p>
  I am not an expert in anything. I am a recent coding bootcamp graduate. My
  purpose in creating this site can best be characterized via a quote from on of
  the most moving works in Buddhist literature,
  <i>How to Lead an Awakened Life</i> by Santideva.
</p>
<blockquote>
  There is nothing here that has not been said before, Nor do I have any skill
  in composition. Thus, I have no concern for others and I have composed my text
  solely to cultivate my own mind. Since my virtue is cultivateed, My faith
  thereby increases in power. Nonetheless, if someone else with an outlook like
  my own Sees this, it would be meaningful.
</blockquote>

<p>
  Thus, my purpose is to solidify my own knowledge of this practice. My hope is
  that the meadium of a blog will allow others to benefit from my 'writing to
  learn' endeavor.
