<h3>About this site</h3>
<p>
  I am an autodidactic programmer. My purpose in creating this site can best be
  characterized via a quote from one of the most moving works in Buddhist
  literature,
  <a
    href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006L8SE58/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_taft_p1_i0"
    ><i>The Way of the Bodhisattva</i></a
  >
  by Santideva.

<blockquote>
  There is nothing here that has not been said before, Nor do I have any skill
  in composition. Thus, I have no concern for others and I have composed my text
  solely to cultivate my own mind. Since my virtue is cultivateed, My faith
  thereby increases in power. Nonetheless, if someone else with an outlook like
  my own Sees this, it would be meaningful.
</blockquote>

<p>
  Thus, my purpose is to solidify my own knowledge of this practice. My hope is
  that the meadium of a blog will allow others to benefit from my
  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Learn-William-Zinsser/dp/0062720406"
    ><i>Writing to Learn</i></a
  >
  endeavor.

  Writing organizes and clarifies our thoughts. Writing is how we think our way
  into a subject and make it our own. Writing enables us to find out what we
  know-and what we don't know-about whatever we're trying to learn.

<p>
  This is a quote from
  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Learn-William-Zinsser/dp/0062720406"
    ><i>Writing to Learn</i></a
  >. I feel this is a distilation of part of my personal reason for this blog.
  The other part is the sincere hope that my writing will benefit other. Thank
  you for reading.
