  best be characterized via a quote from one of the most moving works in
  Buddhist literature,

    ><i>The Way of the Bodhisattva</i></a
  >

  There is nothing here that has not been said before, Nor do I have any skill
  in composition. Thus, I have no concern for others and I have composed my text

  my own Sees this, it would be meaningful.
</blockquote>

<p>
  Thus, my purpose is to solidify my own knowledge of this practice. My hope is
  that the meadium of a blog will allow others to benefit from my

  endeavor.
