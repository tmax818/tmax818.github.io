Okay, to follow along with this tutorial, you need two things:

1. a GitHub account
2. a Bash terminal

Both of these items are free and if you're on a Mac or Linux machine, you already have the second item. A GitHub account is as easy as this:

{% include image.html url="/img/github.png" description="Google GitHub and sign up!" %}

Once you have an account, create a new repository.

{% include image.html url="/img/github.png" description="Google GitHub and sign up!" %}
