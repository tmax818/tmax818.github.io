This a list of resources I have found useful while learning to code.<!--more-->I will start with the free services. Some of the services have a free portion or ask for donations. The paid section will include only those resources that require a subscription fee. I am planning to update this post regularly. Please check back for updates.

## Free

### Start Here

- [Flatiron](https://learn.co/) - So, I am listing this one first because, well, I love Flatiron. There is a free boot-camp prep section that is a teaser for the curriculum in the actual program. I only attempted the prep course after using other more rudimentary resources.
- [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) - This a great place to start! It is totally free, but they are asking for donations much more frequently than they did in the past. Still a great resource.

### Ruby

- [What is ruby?](http://www.rubyist.net/~slagell/ruby/) - A guide to learning Ruby (with code examples). By Matz, the creator of Ruby. Translated into English.
- [The guide](https://poignant.guide/) - I love this book!!!! Be sure to download the soundtrack!

## Paid

- [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/) - This is the first service I paid for. It is very beginner friendly, but it doesn't skimp on the content. They are a bit slow in producing updated courses.
- [in Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning) - This one is on my bookmark bar! Formerly Lynda.com, this has everything you can imagine. Highly recommended!
