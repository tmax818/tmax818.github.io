I am stealing this idea from [Jennifer Dewalt](https://jenniferdewalt.com/). I don't know her personally and I hope this doesn't make her mad at me.<!--more--> So here is my riff on Jennifer's idea. Today is the first official day of my job search. The [boot camp](https://flatironschool.com/) I attended offers a money-back guarantee; if I don't find a job in six months I get the thousands of dollars I paid in tuition back. There are strings attached as you can imagine, but I look at the 'strings' as strategies. To be perfectly candid, the lazy programmer in me truly hopes I don't have to make 180 websites.

Making a website every day is not one of those strings, but I think it's the perfect endeavor for me. I am not really a front-end guy. However, if I am presenting myself as a 'full-stack' web developer, I should probably be able to center an image on a page without having to Google it!

So I am starting by redoing my [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) projects. Please check out [day one](http://www.tylermaxwell.co/tribute_page/). Thanks for reading!
