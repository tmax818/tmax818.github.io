I feel compelled to update my readers, all six of them!<!--more--> So, as I am sure you know I am really on day four. However, as is customary for souls of my ilk, I am a day behind. Ergo, day three. Three days is symbolic for aspiring gym rats, dieters and would-be former smokers. We call it the 'three day hump.' If you can make it three days, you can make it the rest of the way! So [yesterday's website](http://www.tylermaxwell.co/day3/) (that I created today so I can catch up and do today's...well you know the old chestnut!) is rather lean.

Sometimes less is more, case in point:

Anyway, it's my 180 day challenge so, I'll do what I want!
