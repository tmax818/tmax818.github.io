<p>
  This is my <a href="https://sivers.org/nowff">now</a> page, inspired by the
  now page movement generously promoted by
  <a href="https://sivers.org/">Derek Sivers</a>. It’s a page with information
  about what I’m up to now.
</p>

<h3>Professional</h3>
<p>
  I have started a full-time job search for a position as a full-stack web
  developer. My focus is keeping my coding skills honed by developing this
  website and blog.
</p>

<h3>Personal</h3>
<p>
  I have developed a new interest in language learning, especially
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto" target="_blank">Esperanto</a
  >. I am also on a mission to finally master the guitar. My mission is always
  to learn as if I would live forever and love as if I will die tomorrow.
